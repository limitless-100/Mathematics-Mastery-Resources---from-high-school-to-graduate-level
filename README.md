# Mathematics-Mastery-Resources---from-high-school-to-graduate-level
ü§óü§óü§óThis is a comprehensive collection of mathematics resources designed to support self-study from high school to graduate-level topics. Starring this repository will enable it to reach larger audience! üëçüëç

‚ÄºÔ∏è**Disclaimer**‚ÄºÔ∏è As you progress in your mathematics journey, you should not have the wrong mindset that a single book might solve all your problems. Most times, you might need to consult multiples books, coupled with YouTube videos and so on, in order to fully understand the particular topic you are studying.

# Classification of Mathematics
[American Mathematical Society](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/msc2020.html) (AMS) has the most comprehensive file on the classification of mathematics. It is about 230 pages.

# High School
[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) is the best resource to learn grade 1 to 12 mathematics topics. It is also the official platform to prepare for [SAT](https://satsuite.collegeboard.org/sat/registration), as well good (not fully sufficient) for [IGCSE](https://www.cambridgeinternational.org/programmes-and-qualifications/cambridge-upper-secondary/cambridge-igcse/), [AP exam](https://satsuite.collegeboard.org/sat/registration), [IB exam](https://www.ibo.org/programmes/diploma-programme/assessment-and-exams/) and [A-level exam](https://www.cambridgeinternational.org/programmes-and-qualifications/cambridge-advanced/cambridge-international-as-and-a-levels/). Depending on your mathematics goals, if you are someone (e.g undergraduate, working professional) that quickly want to revisit your old mathematics knowledge, Khan Academy is your surest bet.
