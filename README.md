# Classification of Mathematics
[American Mathematical Society](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/msc2020.html) (AMS) has the most comprehensive file on the classification of mathematics. It is about 230 pages.

# High School
[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) is the best resource to learn grade 1 to 12 mathematics topics. It is also the official platform to prepare for [SAT](https://satsuite.collegeboard.org/sat/registration), as well good (not fully sufficient) for [IGCSE](https://www.cambridgeinternational.org/programmes-and-qualifications/cambridge-upper-secondary/cambridge-igcse/), [AP exam](https://satsuite.collegeboard.org/sat/registration), [IB exam](https://www.ibo.org/programmes/diploma-programme/assessment-and-exams/) and [A-level exam](https://www.cambridgeinternational.org/programmes-and-qualifications/cambridge-advanced/cambridge-international-as-and-a-levels/). Depending on your mathematics goals, if you are someone (e.g undergraduate, working professional) that quickly want to revisit your old mathematics knowledge, Khan Academy is your surest bet. 

If you prefer books, you can download these books via the websites given below:
* Cambridge IGCSE, AS & A level coursebooks

# Undergraduate
## Foundations
### Calculus
* [MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-01-single-variable-calculus-fall-2006/) - This introductory calculus course covers differentiation and integration of functions of one variable, with applications.
* [MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-02-multivariable-calculus-fall-2007/) - Covers vector and multi-variable calculus. Topics include vectors and matrices, partial derivatives, double and triple integrals, and vector calculus in 2 and 3-space
* Calculus, 4th edition [by Michael Spivak] - One of the most popular calculus book for undergraduates.
* Calculus Early Transcendentals, 11 edition [by Anton, Bivens, Davis]  - Covers both single variable, multivariable variable and vector calculus. It is easy to understand, with a lot of excercises.
* Calculus of a Single Variable, 10th edition [by Ron Larson] - A top-notch book foor single variable calculus.
* Calculus Early Transcendentals, 9th edition [by James Stewart, Saleem Watson, Daniel Clegg] - Similar to Anthon-Bivens-Davis book.
* Vector Calculus, 4th edition [by Susan Jane Colley] - Similar to Anton boo, but slightly mathematically more intense. 
* Vector Calculus, 6th edition [by Anthony Tombra, Jerrold E. Marsden] - Very similar to Susan Jane book.

### Proof Writing
* Mathematical Proofs: A Transition to Advanced Mathematics, 4th edition [by Ping Zhang, Albert D. Polimeni, Gary Chartrand] - Covers set theory, mathematical induction, logical reasoning, equivalence revaltions, functinos, nuber theory, combinatorics, calculus, group theory, ring theory , linear algebra, etc. It is highly recommended. 
* How to Prove It, 3rd edition [by Velleman Daniel] - A very nice book.
* [Introduction to Proof Writing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGEUOLCYbng) - A full 12-hour YouTube video by MathMajor
* Book of Proof [by Richard Hammack] - A great book and less advanced compared to Mathematical Proofs by Ping Zhang. [Here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLISEtDmihMo395ECdd9fqsIZ9y2LWXnLZ&si=JplKxyt6BK5lmDUj) is the YouTube playlist for the book.
* [Introduction to Mathematical Thinking](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mathematical-thinking) - A popular Coursera course by Dr. Keith Kelvin from Stanford University.
* Proofs [by Jay Cummings] - Very intuitive and fun!
